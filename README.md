# Prime Number Checker
This is a prime number checker that works using positive value integers. If you put a negative value in the program, it would throw an error and quit the program

## Setup
Paste this code into your IDE, and compile it. After that, input the minimum value, and the maximum value. The program would do the rest of the counting.
